# Todos
Todo App (React.js)

Open up the following [link](https://github.com/Santiago-Correa-Dev/todos) in your favorite browser so you can start creating your todo list today.

The app uses localStorage to store your Todo Items and each time you create a todo Item , it will also create a remove button.

Other than that, it will also show the amount of Todo Items pending.
